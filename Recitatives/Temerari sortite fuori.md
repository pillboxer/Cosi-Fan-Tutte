## Context:

After being introduced to the "Albanians", who have instantly professed their undying love to them, the sisters are incredulous. Don Alfonso, however, claims the men are his dear friends, disempowering the women from throwing them out.

The men continue their romancing leading Fiordiligi to attempt once more to convince them to leave.

*Bold ones, get out of this place at once,\
and with unwelcome breath of base words do not profane\
our heart, our ear, and our affections.\
In vain for you, for the others in vain,\
one seeks to seduce our souls.\
The intact faith\
which we have already given\
to our dear lovers,\
we will know how to maintain until death,\
despite the world and destiny!*

<ins>*Bar 44 (starting from Fiordiligi):*</ins> 

**I/V in F Major**. Unaccompanied. Implied C Major, thus the D an anticipatory note.

<ins>*Bar 45:*</ins> 

**V7b**. Strings introduced. Passing A; all else harmony - Despina exits.

<ins>*Bar 46:*</ins> 

**Vb in D Minor**. If following the ossia, Bb is appoggiatura. B natural at the end of the bar is a passing note.

<ins>*Bar 47:*</ins> 

**V7**. Lower auxillary B and passing D. Piano.

<ins>*Bar 48:*</ins> 

**VIIdim**. Passing D. Crescendo.

<ins>*Bar 49:*</ins> 

**VIIdim**. All harmony. Forte

<ins>*Bar 50:*</ins> 

**I**. If following the ossia, Fiordiligi's G is an appoggiatura. Dotted rhythms increase the tension. 

<ins>*Bar 51:*</ins> 

**VIIdim in G Minor**. Fortepiano

<ins>*Bar 52:*</ins> 

**VIIdim**. Bb acciaccatura. Instrumentation is tied

<ins>*Bar 53:*</ins> 

**VIIdim-I**. Ties continue. Ends on Bb to imply I. First change of harmony within a bar.

<ins>*Bar 54:*</ins> 

**I**. Syncopation in strings. Broken chord.

<ins>*Bar 55:*</ins> 

**VIb/Ib in Eb Major - VI7c**. Fiordiligi's C at the end of the bar may arguably be non-functional since it does not feel as the harmony has changed. Piano

<ins>*Bar 56:*</ins> 

**II7**. First G in first violins is non-functional. If following the ossia, Fiordilgi's Bb is an appoggiatura.

<ins>*Bar 57:*</ins> 

**II7**. Semibreves in the instrumentation. Fiordiligi has all harmony notes.

<ins>*Bar 58:*</ins> 

**V7**. If following the ossia, Fiordiligi's Eb is an appoggiatura. E natural in the second violins is particularly chromatic because it is sharpening the tonic. Chromatic passing/lower auxillary in the violas.

<ins>*Bar 59:*</ins> 

**V7**. More sparse than preceding bar. All harmony.

<ins>*Bar 60:*</ins> 

**I**. If following the ossia, Fiordiligi's Ab is an appoggiatura. Syncopation in strings. Broken chord.

<ins>*Bar 61:*</ins> 

**I/IV in Bb Major**. C is non-functional.

<ins>*Bar 62:*</ins> 

**V7**. Dotted rhythms increase tension.

<ins>*Bar 63:*</ins>

**I**. Peak. All harmony.

<ins>*Bar 65:*</ins> 

**I**. All harmony.

<ins>*Bar 66:*</ins> 

**IV-V7d in Bb Major**. Change of key gets us ready for the upcoming aria. Disjunct bar hints at said aria which is full of large leaps. Bb is anticipatory.

<ins>*Bar 67:*</ins> 

**I-V7r**. Triple and double stops in first and second violins respectively.

## Conclusions

#### Melody

Starts off relatively conjunct and gradually becomes more disjunct towards the end which paints angst and anger.

#### Harmony

Diminshed 7th chords and non-functional shifts imply drama, anger and tension. Conversely, minor 7th chords (eg. 56) contrast significantly and may indicate heart vs head.

#### Texture

Fiordilgi is given a recitative accompagnato. Such recitatives were generally reserved for the most dramatic moments by the most heroic characters, and generally led into a formal aria, as this does.

#### Rhythm

The dotted rhythms imbue the recitative with tension and forward motion.
