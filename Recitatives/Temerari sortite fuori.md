## Context:

After being introduced to the "Albanians", who have instantly professed their undying love to them, the sisters are about to throw out the men when Don Alfonso claims the men are his dear friends, disempowering the women from throwing them out.

The men continue their romancing leading Fiordiligi to attempt once more to convince them to leave.

*Bold ones, get out of this place at once,\
and with unwelcome breath of base words do not profane\
our heart, our ear, and our affections.\
In vain for you, for the others in vain,\
one seeks to seduce our souls.\
The intact faith\
which we have already given\
to our dear lovers,\
we will know how to maintain until death,\
despite the world and destiny!*
