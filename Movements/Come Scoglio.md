## Background:

For the premiere, Adriana Ferrarese del Bene was given the leading role of Fiordiligi. Not coincidentally, she was librettist da Ponte's mistress.

She was reportedly "ugly, and not a talented singer, but admired by some for her eyes and her pretty mouth". Mozart did not think highly of her:

*"The leading woman singer, Madame Allegranti is far better than Madame Ferrarese, which, I admit is not saying very much"*

Ferrarese was said to be arrogant and as a result, Mozart came to despise her.

Come Scoglio is full of large vocal leaps (from A below middle C to high C).
Mozart apparently was banking on Ferrarese's habit of lowering her chin on low notes and throwing her head back on high notes, presumably as a practical joke.

## Context:

Following straight from her recitative accompagnato, Fiordiligi dramatically professes her faithfulness and scolds the disguised lovers' advances.

*As a rock, remaining motionless*\
*against the winds and tempest,*\
*yet like this, is this soul strong*\
*in faith and in love.*

*With us is born that torch*\
*which pleases and consoles us,*\
*and death alone will be able*\
*to change the feeling of (our) the heart.*

*Respect, ungrateful souls*\
*this paragon of constancy,*\
*And may a barbarous hope*\
*not make you bold again!*

<ins>*Bar 46:*</ins> 

**Ic-V-VIIc**. Moving to a second inversion arguably at an unusual time may be to preserve scale movement. Written échappè onto the second half of the bar for Fiordiligi, but since the trill will start on the note above the principal note, in practice this is an unaccented passing note.
