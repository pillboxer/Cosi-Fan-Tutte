# Come Scoglio

Adriana Ferrarese del Bene was given the leading role of Fiordiligi. Not coincidentally, she was da Ponte's mistress. She was reportedly "ugly, and not a talented singer, but admired by some for her eyes and her pretty mouth". Mozart did not think highly of her:

	"The leading woman singer, Madame Allegranti is 
	    far better than Madame Ferrarese, which,
	     I admit is not saying very much"

Ferrarese was said to be arrogant and as a result, Mozart came to despise her. Come Scoglio is full of large vocal leaps, and Mozart apparently was banking on Ferrarese's habit of lowering her chin on low notes and throwing her head back on high notes, presumably as a practical joke.
