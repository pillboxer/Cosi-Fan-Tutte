## Background:

For the premiere, Adriana Ferrarese del Bene was given the leading role of Fiordiligi. Not coincidentally, she was librettist da Ponte's mistress.

She was reportedly "ugly, and not a talented singer, but admired by some for her eyes and her pretty mouth". Mozart did not think highly of her:

*"The leading woman singer, Madame Allegranti is far better than Madame Ferrarese, which, I admit is not saying very much"*

Ferrarese was said to be arrogant and as a result, Mozart came to despise her.

Come Scoglio is full of large vocal leaps (from A below middle C to high C).
Mozart apparently was banking on Ferrarese's habit of lowering her chin on low notes and throwing her head back on high notes, presumably as a practical joke.

## Context:

Following straight from her recitative accompagnato, Fiordiligi dramatically professes her faithfulness and scolds the disguised lovers' advances.

*As a rock, remaining motionless*\
*against the winds and tempest,*\
*yet like this, is this soul strong*\
*in faith and in love.*

*With us is born that torch*\
*which pleases and consoles us,*\
*and death alone will be able*\
*to change the feeling of (our) the heart.*

*Respect, ungrateful souls*\
*this paragon of constancy,*\
*And may a barbarous hope*\
*not make you bold again!*
