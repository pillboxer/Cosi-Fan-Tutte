In October 1789, Mozart received, from Emperor Joseph II a commission for a new opera. It likely resulted from the revival of The Marriage Of Figaro at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Lorenzo da Ponte was called upon to provide the libretto.

The story concerns two sisters from Ferrari who are seduced into infidelity by the other's lover.

The first performance was held at the Burgtheater on 26 January 1790 and ten performances were given between January and August.

The origin of the story has reportedly many potential sources: 

Tirso's El amor media and La celosa de si misma\
Ariosto's Orlando Furioso\
Ovid's Metamorphoses \

## ACT 1:

The story takes place in Naples. Two officers Ferrando and Guglielmo believe their lovers to be unwaveringly constant. Their friend, Don Alfonso, an old philosopher, is sceptical. 

Ferrando and Guglielmo enter into a wager with Don Alfonso where the latter must prove the two ladies are capable of infidelity. One hundred zecchini is at stake. The two officers to do whatever Don Alfonso asks.

The two sisters, who live on the Bay of Naples are visited by Don Alfonso who bears bad news. Their lovers have been ordered for service on the battlefield, waiting outside to say goodbye. The sisters' hearts are broken and they swear fidelity in their farewell. The men depart. 

Inside the villa, the maid Despina brushes aside the sisters' posturing and encourages them to not remain faithful whilst the men are away, since undoubtedly, they will be doing the same. The sisters are indignant and storm out.

Alfonso enlists the aid of Despina, whom he fears will be smart enough to recognise the disguises. He bribes her and introduces her other the men in their exotic "Algerian" disguises. She, in fact, does not recognise them, and agrees to help.

The sisters return to find the strangers in their living room. They order Despina to remove them from the house, but before she can, the two men start courting each other's lover. Alfonso reenters and introduces them as friends. The sisters remain indignant, imbuing Ferrando and Guglielmo with confidence of their chances of winning of the bet.

The final scene of the first act sees the disguised men with bottles of "poison" in their hands, pursued by Don Alfonso, who implores them not to kill themself. The soldiers consume it and fall to the feet of the sisters. Despina is sent to fetch a doctor whilst the women stay with the men. Despina reappears, disguised as a doctor and heals them (in the spirit of Doctor Mesmer) with a large magnet. 

As the men recover and beg for affection the sisters can be seen to be briefly thawing, though their residual indignation ensures the first act ends with no indication of infidelity.
